Export Version: pc.2021.7
The Prism Central version the Playbook was exported from - This is important because Playbooks cannot be imported to an older version of PC than they were exported from. Example a Playbook from a pc.2021.1 version cannot be imported into a PC on pc.2020.11 version for compatibility reasons.
